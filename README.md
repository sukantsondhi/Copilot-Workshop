# Hi! Welcome to the Hackathon Repository!

This repository is a collection of resources and guides to help you get started with the hackathon. In this hackathon you can collaborate with other developers, designers, and entrepreneurs to build a project that solves a problem or creates something new.

# Getting started with GitHub

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

### Why with GitHub?
- **Collaboration**: GitHub is a platform that allows you to collaborate with others on projects.

- **Community**: GitHub has a large community of developers who can help you with your projects.

### How to get started with GitHub?
- **Create an account**: Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create an account.
- **Create a repository**: Click on the `+` sign in the top right corner and select `New repository`.
- **Clone the repository**: Click on the green `Code` button and copy the URL. Open your terminal and run `git clone <URL>`.
- **Make changes**: Make changes to the code in your local repository.
- **Commit changes**: Run `git add .` to stage all changes and `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit the changes.
- **Push changes**: Run `git push origin main` to push the changes to the remote repository.
